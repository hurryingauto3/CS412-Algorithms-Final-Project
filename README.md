Introduction
============

The travelling salesman problem has a long history of being a problem of
interest in the field of algorithms. It has garnered much attention and
there has been a lot of work that has been done on it. In this project
we will set out to establish the details of this problem and why it is
so tough. We will then investigate 4 algorithms that have become well
known in being useful for solving this problem. One of them produces an
exact solution and the rest use approximation techniques. We will be
using theory and implementation to test the runtimes of this problem and
will then present our research in an appropriate format.
